Theoretical bound on the convergence of PatchMatch
==================================================

This repo provides code for the computation of a theoretical bound on the 
convergence rate of PatchMatch. It contains:

- `bound/`: code that computes the bound and does several ways of visualizing
it, including a comparison with the empirical real evolution of the
patch-matching cost.
- `patchmatch`: a C implementation of a PatchMatch.
- `patchmatch-m`: a simplified Matlab implementation of PatchMatch.
